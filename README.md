# PopcornAndSodaUpdated
#Versão 2.0

-"Popcorn and Soda" app allows the users to record their favorite movies or tv contents, creating a mini version of "_Netflix_".

- It consists in a local db, where users may record movies, tv shows and respective producer data, in a CRUD functional SQLite db and JAVA as programming language.

- The information about the contents are related with each name, year of release, producers, trailers in video, etc.

- The app provides a clean way to add movies on the favorite´s list.

-- After I finished college I made a newer version from PopcornAndSoda listed in https://github.com/vascoventura/PopcornAndSoda. I started to learn something new out of college and I think I gave a big improvement in 2.0v.
